# NBA Playoffs  Project

In this project I look explore a dataset concerning the National Basketball Association.  Specifically, I was curious to see if there were some indication based on a player's in-game statistics that they would retire at the end of the season.  Is there a certain age at wich we see players simply grow too old to keep up with the athleticism of the game? If players simply are not perfoming well, do their teams take them off their roster thus removing the player from the league?

I then looked into my methods to evaluate how I could improve my model.  With these findings in hand, I finally tried to determine if my model had become biased as I trained it.
